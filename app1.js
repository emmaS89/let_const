// What is the difference between let and const?
// What is hoisting?

// *****************************************************

// Example 1

// What is the difference between var and let?

// var => we can reassign and redeclare the variable
// let => we can reassign, but not redeclare the variable
// Var scope => is funtion scope =>  we can access a hoisted variable with var
// let scope => is block scope

// *******************************************************

// Example 2

// What is the difference between var and const?

// var => we can reassign and redeclare the variable.
// const => we cannot reassign and redeclared

// Var scope => is funtion scope =>  we can access a hoisted variable with var
// const scope => is block scope

// Example 3
// What is the difference between let and const?

// let => we can reassign, but not redeclare the variable
// const => we cannot reassign and redeclare the variable

// Example4

// What is hoisting?
// Hoisting => JS compiler
// we can access the created var variable before given a value. It's undefined.
// if we invoked the function declaration before run the code => JS compiler can execute it.
